          Julian Collazo Bass is a director of photography based in NYC. Born
          and raised in New York, Julian graduated from the SUNY Purchase
          Photography and New Media Program and has established himself as a
          versatile cinematographer in the narrative, commercial, and music
          video spaces.

          His recent narrative credits include 2nd Unit Photography on Down Low
          with director Rightor Doyle, written by and starring Lukas Gage and
          Zachary Quinto (SXSW Film Festival 2023 premiere) and Which Brings Me
          to You with writer director Peter Hutchings, starring Lucy Hale and
          Nat Wolff.

        <p>
          In college he played divisional tennis and basketball and he has lived
          abroad in Paris, Istanbul and Merida. Julianâ€™s background influences
          his fresh perspective and global awareness as a cinematographer and he
          brings the collaborative spirit and tenacity of an athlete to all of
          his work.
